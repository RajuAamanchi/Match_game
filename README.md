# 🎮 Match Game (React Project)  

This is a **fun image matching game** built with **ReactJS**.  
It was developed as part of my React learning journey to practice **state management, conditional rendering, timers, and event handling**.  

***

## 📌 Overview  

- The player is shown a **main image** that must be matched with one of the correct thumbnail images.  
- A **60-second timer** runs during the game.  
- Correct matches increase the score by `+1`.  
- A **wrong match** or **time running out** ends the game.  
- Final score is displayed on a **Scorecard screen** with an option to **Play Again**.  



***

## 🚀 Features  

- ⏱️ Countdown timer from 60 seconds.  
- 🎯 Score increases on each correct match.  
- ✅ Tabs to filter images by categories (Fruits, Animals, Places).  
- ❌ Wrong attempt ends the game instantly.  
- 🔄 Play Again button resets the game.  
- 📱 Fully responsive design.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  

- **ReactJS (Hooks & Functional Components)**  
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**

## 📚 Learning Outcomes  

Through this project I practiced:  
- Using **React state management** with `useState`.  
- Implementing **countdown timers** in React with `setInterval`.  
- Working with **map()** to render lists dynamically.  
- **Conditional rendering** for different game views.  
- Splitting into **reusable components** (`Header`, `TabsList`, `ThumbnailItem`, `ScoreCard`).
